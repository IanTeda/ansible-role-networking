# =============================================================================
# Nginx Location Block for UniFi Network Server
# =============================================================================
#
# This location block proxies requests to the UniFi Network Server running on port 8443.
# It handles HTTPS proxying with WebSocket support for real-time communication.
# Configured for subpath access at /{{ unifi_nginx_path }}/
#
# Requirements:
#   - UniFi Network Server installed and running on localhost:8443
#   - Included in main server block via: include config.d/{{ nginx_server_name }}-*.conf
#
# Security Notes:
#   - Only accessible through the parent server block's SSL configuration
#   - Self-signed certificate verification disabled for UniFi's default cert
#
# Author: Generated by Ansible
# =============================================================================

# IMPORTANT: UniFi does not officially support subpath proxying.
# For full functionality, use one of these approaches instead:
#   1. Access UniFi directly at https://homenetwork.com:8443
#   2. Use a dedicated subdomain: https://unifi.homenetwork.com (root path proxy)
#   3. Use a dedicated server block that proxies / to UniFi
#
# This subpath configuration (/{{ unifi_nginx_path }}) will have limited functionality
# as UniFi generates many absolute URLs that cannot be reliably rewritten.
